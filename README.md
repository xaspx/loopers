Loopers is a baremetal, zero-delay circuit breaker for AI API billing. It intercepts requests across **500+ AI models natively** (across 14 providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, vLLM, and more), plus **any OpenAI-compatible endpoint**, to prevent token overspending, stop runaway agent loops, and safeguard against catastrophic bill shocks like LLMjacking.

---

## What's New

**Enterprise-Grade Security Architecture**
We have significantly hardened Loopers for bare-metal and zero-trust deployments:
- **Dedicated Admin Server:** Telemetry (`/metrics`) and health checks are now isolated on a dedicated admin port (default `9090`), preventing internal state exposure when the main proxy (`8080`) is public.
- **Strict TLS Enforcement:** Production deployments now mandate TLS certificates to start, preventing accidental plaintext exposure.
- **Hardened Redis Integrations:** Redis connections now require password authentication natively out of the box in our Helm charts and Compose templates.

**Bring Your Own Provider (Generic OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints)**
You are no longer limited to the built-in providers! Loopers now supports routing to *any* OpenAI-compatible endpoint (like vLLM, OpenRouter, local Llama.cpp, or custom proxies) while still maintaining full budget enforcement, mid-stream cutoffs, and loop detection. Configure them easily via `generic_providers` in `loopers.yaml`.

**Dynamic Remote Pricing Fetcher**
Tired of manually updating `pricing.yaml` when models change prices? Loopers can now automatically fetch the latest token pricing from a remote JSON endpoint at a configured interval. This ensures your budget accounting is always 100% accurate, completely hands-free.

**LangChain & LlamaIndex Native Adapters**
We've published official adapters for the Python SDK! You can now drop Loopers into your existing LangChain (`ChatLoopers`) or LlamaIndex (`LoopersLLM`) workflows with a single line of code. They automatically handle session IDs, step counting, and budget headers out-of-the-box.

**Structured Security Event Emission (OWASP Top 10 for LLMs 2025)**
Loopers now natively aligns with the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)](https://genai.owasp.org/) standard. Every budget block and loop detection trigger emits a structured JSON security event tagged with the precise OWASP category (e.g., `LLM06:2025` for Excessive Agency, `LLM10:2025` for Unbounded Consumption) and severity. Events are always emitted to `stdout` for local observability, and can optionally be POSTed to a `webhook_url`. A versioned JSON schema is provided in `docs/reference/event-schema.json`.

**Deterministic Loop Detection Engine (v1.1)**
We just released our enterprise-grade, deterministic loop detection engine designed specifically for High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and critical infrastructure agents. It features three advanced sub-detectors:
- **Fingerprint Ring**: Sliding window O(1) exact hash matching with volatile field stripping (ignores temperature/seed variance).
- **Velocity Limiter**: Highly granular RPS and endpoint repetition bounding using atomic Redis tracking.
- **Stall Detector**: Uses Hamming distance over request hashes within a `TxPipelined` Watch transaction to detect low-diversity "stuck" agents in a TOCTOU-safe manner.

*Enable it via the new `loop:` block in `loopers.yaml`!*

---

## Why Loopers?

If an autonomous agent gets stuck in a loop or an API key is compromised, it can burn thousands of dollars in minutes. Loopers is not an alert or a dashboard—it's a **kill-switch**:

- **Atomic Correctness Guarantee**: Executes checks in a single Redis Lua transaction, preventing TOCTOU race conditions under extreme concurrency.
- **Zero-Storage Security Model**: Pass-through architecture. Your API keys are only kept in-memory during request lifecycles. Zero persistence to disk/database, rendering it immune to data breaches.
- **Sub-Millisecond Overhead**: Written in Go using `httputil.ReverseProxy` and Redis, adding only ~1-2ms of latency to the request path. No cold starts, no blocking streaming performance.
- **Fail-Closed Guarantee**: Fails closed if Redis or the proxy goes down, instantly blocking requests to protect your wallet.
- **Mid-Stream Cutoffs**: Intercepts streaming Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses, counts tokens in real-time, and severs the connection instantly if limits are exceeded.

## Try It In 60 Seconds (No Go Required)

Want to see Loopers block a runaway request before touching your real API keys? Start the self-contained demo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xaspx/loopers.git
cd loopers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up
```

Check the `bootstrap` container logs for the ready curl commands. The demo uses a mock OpenAI server so you won't spend any real credits.

---

## Quickstart (Production Setup)

- [ ] **Step 1: Download the Binary**

**macOS / Linux (one-liner):**
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/xaspx/loopers/releases/latest/download/loopers_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz && sudo mv loopers /usr/local/bin/
```

**Or pull the Docker image directly:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/xaspx/loopers:latest
```

**Or initialize via the wizard** (requires Go):
```bash
go run github.com/loopers/loopers/cmd/loopers init
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Spin Up the Proxy**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Create a Key and Configure a Budget**
Generate an API proxy key for OpenAI:
```bash
docker-compose exec loopers /app/loopers keys create --name my-app-key --provider openai
```
*Note the generated raw key (`lp-xxx`) and its hash.*

Set budget limits across 5 granular time windows for the key hash:
```bash
docker-compose exec loopers /app/loopers budget set <KEY_HASH> \
  --minute 0.50 \
  --hourly 2.00 \
  --daily 10.00 \
  --weekly 50.00 \
  --monthly 150.00
```

All five windows (`--minute`, `--hourly`, `--daily`, `--weekly`, `--monthly`) are optional and can be combined freely. The first limit hit wins and blocks the request.

- [ ] **Step 4: Route Your Requests**
Make API calls through the Loopers proxy using one of our official SDKs or raw cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <RAW_LP_KEY>" \
  -H "X-Loopers-Provider-Key: <YOUR_REAL_OPENAI_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Loopers!"}]
  }'
```

## Zero-SDK Integration

If you cannot use our SDK wrappers, you can use any standard OpenAI-compatible client by configuring it to point to Loopers and injecting the required HTTP headers using the `default_headers` parameter available in most SDKs.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/openai/v1", # Route through Loopers proxy
    api_key="lp-xxx", # Your Loopers proxy key
    default_headers={
        "X-Loopers-Provider-Key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        "X-Loopers-Session-ID": "agent-run-123",
    }
)
```

---

## Client SDKs

Integrate Loopers easily into your code using our client wrappers:

### Python SDK
```bash
pip install loopers-client
```
```python
from loopers_client import LoopersOpenAI

client = LoopersOpenAI(
    loopers_url="http://localhost:8080",
    loopers_key="lp-xxx",
    provider_key="sk-proj-...",
    session_id="agent-run-1",
    session_budget=5.00,
    max_steps=20
)
```

### TypeScript / Node.js SDK
```bash
npm install @loopers/client
```
```typescript
import { LoopersOpenAI } from '@loopers/client';

const client = new LoopersOpenAI({
  loopersUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
  loopersKey: 'lp-xxx',
  providerKey: 'sk-proj-...',
  sessionId: 'agent-run-1',
  sessionBudget: 5.00,
  maxSteps: 20
});
```

For full details, see the [Python SDK documentation](./sdk/python/README.md) and [TypeScript SDK documentation](./sdk/ts/README.md).

## Architecture

Loopers acts as a transparent reverse proxy between your application clients and the upstream LLM providers, utilizing Redis for atomic budget reservation and transaction management.

For a detailed system overview and sequence diagram, please see our [Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture.md).

---

## Monitoring

Loopers exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint out of the box on a dedicated, isolated admin port (default: `9090`). A pre-built Grafana dashboard is included in [`./grafana/`](./grafana/) for instant observability into request throughput, budget block rates, and latency percentiles.

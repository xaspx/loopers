# API Headers Reference

Loopers uses headers to get settings from your application and return information about each request. You can think of headers as stickers on a package that give instructions or show details.

## Request Headers

| Header | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Authorization: Bearer `<KEY>` | Yes | Your Loopers proxy key, OR your real upstream provider key if using Zero-Code Path Integration. |
| X-Loopers-Provider-Key | Yes* | Your real AI provider API key (*Not required if using Zero-Code Path Integration) |
| X-Loopers-Session-ID | No | Unique name for this session (for loop detection) |
| X-Loopers-Session-Budget | No | Maximum spending limit in USD for this session |
| X-Loopers-Session-Max-Steps | No | Maximum AI calls allowed for this session |
| Content-Type: application/json | Yes | Required for all POST requests |

## Response Headers

:::note
All `X-Loopers-*` budget and telemetry response headers can be completely suppressed by setting `server.strip_budget_headers: true` in your configuration (`loopers.yaml`).
:::

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| X-Loopers-Request-Cost | The real cost of this request in USD |
| X-Loopers-Session-Spend | The total cost spent in this session so far |

| X-Loopers-Session-Remaining | The remaining budget left in your most limited window |

| 429 Too Many Requests | max_steps_exceeded | You have reached the maximum allowed calls for this session |

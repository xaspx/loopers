# What's New in Loopers

Stay up to date with the newest capabilities we've added to the Loopers cost firewall.

---

## Tool Blast Radius Risk Scoring (Layer 5)
Loopers now computes an intrinsic risk score (0–100) and risk tier (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`) for every MCP and LLM tool execution before passing it to policy evaluation:
- **Deterministic Factor Engine (`internal/blastradius`)**: Evaluates destructive verbs (+35), OS shell execution (+30), IAM & secret targets (+25), production databases & cluster scopes (+25), financial transfers (+25), external egress URLs/IPs (+25), and bulk wildcards/traversals (+20) with pure read-only mitigations (-10).
- **Sub-10µs Performance**: Zero-dependency, memory-safe execution benchmarked at <7µs per tool call.
- **OPA & YAML Integration**: Exposes `input.action.blast_radius`, `input.action.blast_radius_tier`, and `input.action.blast_radius_reasons` for simple declarative rules (`field: action.blast_radius, op: greater_than, value: 60` -> `escalate`).
- **Enhanced Presets**: Updates the built-in `mcp_sandbox` preset to escalate tool calls with blast radius >60 and deny critical operations (>=85).
* **Learn More**: See the [Policy Engine Guide](/docs/guides/policy-engine#mcp_sandbox-mcp-blast-radius-prevention).

## Compliance Policy Presets: OWASP Top 10, NIST AI RMF & EU AI Act (Layer 6)
Loopers now embeds production-ready compliance policy presets that map directly to global AI security and regulatory standards without requiring external policy servers:
- **`owasp_llm_top10`**: Defends against LLM01 (Prompt Injection & Drift), LLM02 (Insecure Output / RCE), LLM06 (DB connection strings & Private keys), and LLM08 (Excessive Agency & Destructive tool escalation).
- **`nist_ai_rmf`**: Enforces NIST SP 1270 AI risk categories including mandatory agent owner traceability (GOVERN 1.1), persistent behavioral risk score quarantine (MEASURE 2.7), high-consequence IAM & financial escalation (MANAGE 2.4), and objective drift containment (MANAGE 4.1).
- **`eu_ai_act`**: Enforces EU Regulation 2024/1689 compliance, prohibiting Article 5 practices (subliminal cognitive manipulation, citizen social scoring, remote biometric surveillance) and enforcing Article 14 mandatory human oversight on recruitment screening and credit scoring.
* **Learn More**: See the [Policy Engine Guide](/docs/guides/policy-engine#out-of-the-box-presets--templates).

## Expanded Syntactic Normalization: Homoglyphs & Encoding Attacks (Layer 3)
An embedded 5-stage de-obfuscation pipeline (`internal/syntactic`) runs on all inbound prompts and outbound tool responses:
- Resolves Unicode lookalikes (Cyrillic, Greek, Math Bold, Fullwidth, Enclosed) to ASCII via Unicode TR39 tables and NFKC normalization.
- Strips 28+ zero-width runes, directional overrides, and soft hyphens.
- Recursively unescapes multi-layer URL percent encoding, hex, unicode, and HTML entities.
- Extracts Base64 printable text layers for deep regex inspection without corrupting raw binary data.
- Automatically exposes `normalized_prompt` and `obfuscation.*` telemetry to OPA and dual-matches YAML rules.
* **Learn More**: See the [Security Model](/docs/security_model).

## Transient Session Buffer (Stateful Tracing)
Operators can now evaluate actual request and response text payloads (prompts, completions, tool inputs, and tool outputs) in OPA/Rego and Declarative YAML policies. Loopers captures execution history dynamically in Redis as JSON-serialized events under `input.session.traces`.

To protect user privacy and avoid memory bloat, all stored prompt/response payloads are strictly truncated to 512 characters, and the history is capped at the 15 most recent entries (managed via Redis `LPUSH`/`LTRIM`). This enables advanced multi-turn policy enforcement (e.g., *"block file writes if a database query returned confidential customer data earlier in the session"*) while maintaining Loopers' zero-storage-on-disk guarantee.
* **Learn More**: See the [Policy Engine Guide](/docs/guides/policy-engine#transient-session-buffer).

## Stateful Session Context (Taint Tracking)
OPA policies can now evaluate the historical execution trace of a session. Loopers passes `input.session.taint_flags` and `input.session.tools_called` to OPA before every request. Whenever sensitive tools (such as `read_secret`, `get_credentials`, `vault_read`) are invoked, Loopers automatically sets session taint flags (e.g. `secret_accessed`). This enables cross-call data exfiltration prevention rules such as: *"if secret_accessed taint is set in step 2, block all outbound_http calls in step 5"*.
* **Learn More**: See the [Policy Engine Guide](/docs/guides/policy-engine).

## Agent-Friendly Policy Denial Formats (Self-Correction)
When an OPA policy blocks an MCP tool call, Loopers now returns a valid **MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 error object** at **HTTP 200** (code `-32001`) with the `X-Loopers-Policy-Block: true` header. Most agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI) surface this to the LLM as a tool failure message rather than crashing on an HTTP 403 exception, allowing the LLM planner to **self-correct** its strategy in real-time. SDK wrappers for Python and TypeScript also include `LoopersPolicyDenied`, `parse_policy_denial()`, and `onPolicyBlock` callbacks.
* **Learn More**: See the [Python SDK](/docs/sdks/python) or [TypeScript SDK](/docs/sdks/typescript) guides.

## Fuzzy Bi-Gram Jaccard Agent Loop Detection
We've completely overhauled our agent loop detection engine. Exact-hash detection (like FNV-1a) is often easily bypassed by modern LLMs and agents that slightly mutate their prompts when stuck in a loop (e.g., adding attempt counters or subtle rephrasing). 
Loopers self-hosted v1.1+ now uses **Bi-Gram Jaccard Similarity** to compare request token sets. It calculates the exact structural similarity between prompts, allowing it to catch polymorphic, mutating agent loops that exact matching cannot. You can tune the sensitivity using the new `similarity_threshold` configuration (default 0.95).
* **Learn More**: See the new [Agent Loop Detection](/docs/concepts/agent-loop-detection) guide.

## Local Policy Engine (OPA/Rego)
Loopers now includes an embedded Open Policy Agent (OPA) engine for fine-grained, attribute-based access control. Write `.rego` policies to govern which agents can access which models, block destructive MCP tools, and enforce environment-level restrictions — all evaluated at the network layer before any request is forwarded upstream. Policies are hot-reloaded within 500ms when files change, with zero downtime.
* **Learn More**: See the [Policy Engine Guide](/docs/guides/policy-engine).

## Agent Identity & Key Metadata
Every proxy key can now carry rich identity metadata including `agent_name`, `owner`, `allowed_tools`, `allowed_providers`, and arbitrary `tags` (key=value pairs). This identity flows into policy evaluation, OpenTelemetry trace spans, and security event webhooks, enabling full audit trails and per-agent governance.

## CrewAI & AutoGen Framework Adapters
We have launched native Python SDK adapters for CrewAI and Microsoft AutoGen. Drop in `get_loopers_crewai_llm()` to return a LangChain `ChatOpenAI` instance routed through Loopers, or use `get_loopers_autogen_config()` to generate an AutoGen-compatible `llm_config` dictionary. All Loopers features — budget enforcement, loop detection, and policy evaluation — are applied automatically.
* **Learn More**: See the [Framework Adapters Guide](/docs/guides/framework-adapters).

## Per-Key Rate Limiting
A new sliding window rate limiter powered by an atomic Redis Lua script allows you to cap request velocity per key, independent of budget limits. Configure `rate_limit.requests_per_minute` in your `loopers.yaml` to set the threshold. The limiter returns `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers and emits structured `rate_limit_block` security events.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Governance
Loopers governs Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic natively. We have shipped a transparent JSON-RPC 2.0 proxy that enforces per-tool cost budgets (e.g., $0.05 per Snowflake query, $0.001 per GitHub API call). It also features a deterministic tool-call circuit breaker to stop agents from executing infinite runaway loops. This feature establishes Loopers as the definitive enforcement layer for agentic workloads.

## Local Lease Budget Guard Loop
To provide high-throughput rate-limiting under extreme concurrent loads, Loopers utilizes a local lease/budget cache mechanism. It reserves a budget lease from Redis and performs atomic deductions locally in memory, keeping latency to 1-2 milliseconds. The background guard loop reconciles spent totals and blocks keys within seconds, keeping any potential concurrent budget leakage capped.

## Security Events Webhooks
Security and auditing just got much easier. You can now configure Loopers to POST structured security events directly to your SIEM or custom webhook endpoints. This allows security teams to instantly react to anomalies, budget breaches, or potential credential leaks without polling the database.
* **Configure**: Set `alerting.webhook_url` in your `loopers.yaml` configuration.

## OpenTelemetry (OTel) Tracing
To help enterprises meet stringent compliance requirements (like the EU AI Act), Loopers now includes first-class OpenTelemetry support. When enabled, every prompt, response, and budget transaction is fully traced across your microservices architecture.
* **Configure**: Set `otel.enabled: true` in your `loopers.yaml` configuration.

## LangChain & LlamaIndex Native Adapters
We have officially launched native drop-in adapters for both Python and TypeScript. You no longer need to manually construct HTTP requests to the Loopers proxy. You can just drop `ChatLoopers` into your LangChain workflow or `LoopersLLM` into your LlamaIndex pipelines with a single line of code.
* **Learn More**: See the [Python SDK](/docs/sdks/python) or [TypeScript SDK](/docs/sdks/typescript) guides.

## Session Budgets
Along with global provider limits, you can now define Session Budgets. This allows you to cap the exact amount of money a specific user, chat session, or autonomous agent can spend in a single run. Simply pass the `session_id` and `session_budget` headers!
* **Learn More**: Read the deep-dive on [Session Budgets](/docs/concepts/session-budgets).

## 15 Provider Integrations & Stable SDK Launch
The initial stable release of Loopers marked the launch of our SDKs alongside native proxy support for 15 leading AI providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Fireworks, Ollama, vLLM, and xAI.

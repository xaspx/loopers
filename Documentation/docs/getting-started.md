# Getting Started with Loopers

Loopers is a tool that helps you control how much money you spend on AI. It works like a smart guard for your wallet. When your application wants to talk to an AI service, it sends the request to Loopers first. Loopers checks if you have enough money left in your budget. If you do, it forwards the request. If you do not, it stops the request immediately to prevent you from spending too much.

This guide will help you get set up and protected in under five minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need:
* Go 1.25 or higher (required when building from source)
* Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for running Redis)

## Method 1: Docker (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to run Loopers in production or local development without installing Go.

### Step 1: Get the Docker Compose file

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xaspx/loopers.git
cd loopers
```

### Step 2: Start Redis and the Proxy

Start both the proxy server and the Redis database in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Create a proxy key

Create a security key for your application. This key replaces your real AI provider key in your code:

```bash
docker-compose exec loopers /app/loopers keys create --name mykey --provider openai
```

Write down your raw key. It starts with lp and is only shown once. Copy it immediately.

### Step 4: Set a budget limit

Configure how much this key is allowed to spend:

```bash
docker-compose exec loopers /app/loopers budget set KEY_HASH --minute 0.50 --hourly 2.00 --daily 10.00 --weekly 50.00 --monthly 150.00
```

All spending limits are optional. The first limit you reach will block any further requests.

### Step 5: Route your first request

Point your application at the Loopers proxy:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer RAW_LP_KEY" \
  -H "X-Loopers-Provider-Key: YOUR_REAL_OPENAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Loopers"}]}'
```

*Alternatively, use path-based auth for agents (like `opencode` or `codex`) that don't support custom headers:*

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/RAW_LP_KEY/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REAL_OPENAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Loopers"}]}'
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://localhost:8080/RAW_LP_KEY/openai/v1/chat/completions" `
  -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer YOUR_REAL_OPENAI_KEY"; "Content-Type"="application/json"} `
  -Body '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Loopers"}]}'
```

---

## Method 2: Native Installation (Go 1.25+)

If you want to run the proxy natively on your machine or just use the CLI wrapper for agents (`loopers exec`).

### Step 1: Install the CLI globally

**macOS / Linux / Windows:**
```bash
go install github.com/xaspx/loopers/cmd/loopers@latest
```

### Step 2: Initialize Configuration

This creates a `loopers.yaml` configuration file and a `docker-compose.yml` (for Redis) in your current directory.

```bash
loopers init
```

### Step 3: Start Redis

Start only the Redis container in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d redis
```

> **Note:** If you already have Redis running locally (e.g. via Homebrew, apt, or a remote instance), you can skip this step. Just make sure the `redis.addr` in your `loopers.yaml` points to your existing Redis instance.

> [!WARNING]
> The default Redis password in the generated `docker-compose.yml` was recently updated from `changeme_in_production` to `demo-pass`. If you generated your compose file in an older version, make sure the `REDIS_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml` matches `redis.password` in your `loopers.yaml`.

### Step 4: Start the Proxy Server

Start the server in development mode (without TLS):

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
SERVER_INSECURE_DEV=true loopers serve
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:SERVER_INSECURE_DEV="true"; loopers serve
```

### Step 5: Create a Key and Route Requests

In a **new terminal window**, you can now run Loopers commands directly against your local proxy:

```bash
loopers keys create --name mykey --provider openai
```

## Next Steps

* Read the [Architecture](./architecture) guide to understand how Loopers works
* Learn about [Budget Windows](./concepts/budget-windows) to fine tune your limits
* Connect your code with the [Python SDK](./sdks/python)
* Check the [CLI Reference](./reference/cli) for a list of all commands

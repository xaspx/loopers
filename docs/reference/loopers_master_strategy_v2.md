# The Holy Grail: Loopers Master Strategy v2.0

**Document Classification:** Internal — Founder Eyes Only
**Last Updated:** July 18, 2026
**Version:** 2.1

> [!CAUTION]
> **Critical Change from v1.0:** The SaaS is **not** the OSS with extra features bolted on. The OSS and SaaS are architecturally separate systems with separate codebases, separate CI/CD pipelines, and a zero-trust boundary between them. A vulnerability in the publicly auditable OSS code must have **zero exploitability** against the SaaS infrastructure.

## 1. The Category We Are Creating

### The Name: **Agent Runtime Governance (ARG)**

No one owns this category today. LiteLLM sells routing. Portkey sells observability. LangSmith sells tracing. None of them sell **guarantees**.

Loopers will define Agent Runtime Governance as:

> *The mandatory infrastructure layer that provides cryptographic guarantees of bounded behavior — financially, operationally, and security-wise — for every autonomous AI agent in production.*

This is not a proxy. This is not a dashboard. This is the **firewall for the agentic era**.

### Why This Category Will Exist

| Force | Evidence (June 2026) | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Catastrophic Agent Incidents** | $8K–$50K weekend runaway bills are routine. GitHub paused Copilot signups (April 2026) because agentic workloads overwhelmed infrastructure. | Enterprises need kill-switches, not dashboards. |
| **Regulatory Mandate** | EU AI Act high-risk obligations enforceable August 2, 2026. NIST launched AI Agent Standards Initiative (Feb 2026). Agent Control Standard (ACS) published May 2026. | Governance tools become compliance requirements. |
| **MCP Standardization** | MCP has 97M+ monthly SDK downloads, 10,000+ servers, 28% Fortune 500 adoption. But MCP was designed for capability, not defense — tool poisoning, prompt injection, and data exfiltration are documented threats. | A standardized interception point exists, and it desperately needs a governance layer. |
| **The OWASP Agentic AI Top 10** | ASI01–ASI10 published, covering Goal Hijack, Tool Misuse, Identity Abuse, Supply Chain, Code Execution, Memory Poisoning, Insecure Inter-Agent Comms, Cascading Failures, Trust Exploitation, Rogue Agents. | The threat taxonomy is now formalized. Enterprise security teams have a checklist — and need tools to satisfy it. |

### The Market Size

| Metric | AI Agents Market | AI Governance Market |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (Current)** | ~$7–10B | ~$1.5–2B |
| **CAGR** | ~43–47% | ~35–50%+ |
| **2030 Projection** | $46B–$53B | $5.6B–$7.4B |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By 2027, 60% of enterprises are predicted to experience an AI governance failure. 40% of agentic AI projects will be cancelled due to weak risk controls. Every one of those failures is a Loopers customer waiting to happen.

## 2. The Complete ARG Stack — 6 Layers

Based on verified industry research (OWASP, NIST, CSA, ACS), the complete ARG platform comprises six functional layers. Each layer builds on the one below it.

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Loopers Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Identity & Authentication | Establish *who* the agent is | OSS + SaaS |
| **2** | Policy & Decision Engine | Define *what* the agent is allowed to do | OSS (local) + SaaS (fleet) |
| **3** | Execution & Interception | Physically intercept every action | **OSS (core strength)** |
| **4** | Observability & Traceability | Capture "decision provenance" — the *why* | OSS (export) + SaaS (analysis) |
| **5** | Operational & Resource Mgmt | Protect infrastructure and budgets | **OSS (core strength)** |
| **6** | Compliance & Attestation | Generate verifiable proof of governance | **SaaS only** |

## 3. The 5-Year Market Timeline

| Year | Milestone | Loopers Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | EU AI Act enforced. ACS published. OWASP ASI01–ASI10 formalized. | **Ship OSS v1** with Layers 3+5 hardened. Be the definitive MCP Security Proxy. |
| **2027** | 60% governance failures. Demand spike. AI talent scarcity peaks. | **Ship SaaS v1** with fleet dashboard, centralized policy push, and decision provenance UI. |
| **2028** | 33% of enterprise apps include agentic AI. 15% of daily decisions autonomous. | **Scale the SaaS.** Multi-agent governance. A2A protocol mediation. Marketplace for policy packs. |
| **2029** | AI-to-AI collaboration normalizes. Self-improving agents emerge. | **"Loopers Verified" certification** becomes an industry standard for agent security. |
| **2030** | AI governance market exceeds $5B+. AI performance ROI is a board-level metric. | **Category leadership.** Foundation donation. Insurance partnerships. Standards body influence. |

## 4. Competitive Kill Chart

| Company | What They Do | Why Loopers Wins |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LiteLLM** | Python LLM router with post-call budget tracking | Post-call = after the money is spent. Loopers does pre-call atomic reservation. 25x throughput, 0% leakage. |
| **Bifrost** | Go AI gateway with MCP tool filtering | Policy-based, not cost-based. No atomic budget per tool call. No fail-closed guarantee. |
| **Lasso Security** | Shadow AI discovery, prompt firewalling | Prompt-layer only. No tool-call interception, no policy engine, no identity plane. |
| **CalypsoAI** | Enterprise GenAI governance, PII masking | Application-plane (Rung 4). If the agent is compromised, CalypsoAI's guardrails go with it. |
| **GuardionAI** | Sub-50ms runtime inspection of tool calls | Closest competitor architecturally. But no OSS community wedge. No data flywheel. |
| **Zenity** | Build-time to runtime governance | Strong but closed-source. Cannot replicate OSS adoption flywheel. |
| **Portkey/Palo Alto** | Unified AI control plane (acquired) | Now a feature in Prisma Cloud. Enterprise sales cycles. Not a standalone category leader. |

> [!TIP]
> **Loopers' kill shot across all competitors:** An open-source, framework-agnostic, out-of-process proxy that achieves **Rung 5 (Two-Plane Verified)** on the Enforceability Ladder. No competitor offers this combination. Most are stuck at Rung 4 (application-plane enforced).

# SECTION A: THE OSS PRODUCT

## 5. OSS Mission & Scope

### Mission
> Make Loopers OSS the most adopted agent governance engine on the planet. Solve an immediate, painful problem — runaway costs, infinite loops, unauthorized tool execution — for every developer running AI agents.

### What OSS Is
The OSS is the **Data Plane** — the enforcement muscle that sits in the hot path. It must be:
- **Trustworthy:** Fully auditable, MIT-licensed, forkable.
- **Self-contained:** Works perfectly with zero external dependencies beyond Redis.
- **Fast:** Sub-millisecond overhead on the hot path.
- **Fail-closed:** If Loopers goes down, agents stop. Not the other way around.

### What OSS Is NOT
- ❌ A crippled demo of the SaaS.
- ❌ A library imported by the SaaS.
- ❌ A codebase that shares auth, session, or tenant logic with the SaaS.

### OSS Boundary Map

| Capability | In OSS? | Rationale |
|---|:---:|---|
| Core Proxy Engine (Go + `httputil.ReverseProxy`) | ✅ | Must be auditable and trusted. |
| Atomic Lua Budget Enforcement (Redis) | ✅ | Core value prop. |
| Fail-Closed Guarantee | ✅ | Security property, must be verifiable. |
| Mid-Stream SSE Cutoff | ✅ | Core circuit-breaking. |
| Loop Detection (Fingerprint, Velocity, Stall) | ✅ | Builds community trust. |
| MCP Tool-Call Interception (JSON-RPC 2.0) | ✅ | Drives MCP ecosystem adoption. |
| Tool-Call Circuit Breaking (exact-match) | ✅ | Safety-critical, auditable. |
| Frequency Limiting / Blast-Radius Bounds | ✅ | Extends the wedge beyond dollars. |
| Session TTL / Tool Invocation Caps | ✅ | Deterministic circuit breakers. |
| Local Policy Enforcement (OPA/Rego from file) | ✅ | Makes OSS genuinely useful for governance, not just cost control. |
| Basic Agent Identity (local API key issuance) | ✅ | Foundational for any policy enforcement. |
| OpenTelemetry Export (GenAI conventions) | ✅ | Rich data generation. "Bring Your Own Backend." |
| Prometheus Metrics | ✅ | Standard observability, table stakes. |
| Helm Chart + Docker Compose | ✅ | Self-hosted deployment. |

# SECTION B: THE SAAS PRODUCT

## 8. SaaS Mission & Scope

### Mission
> Become the control plane that every enterprise with 10+ agents needs. Sell to CISOs, platform teams, and compliance officers. Monetize through fleet management, advanced analytics, and compliance artifacts.

### What SaaS Is
The SaaS is the **Control Plane** — the intelligence layer that manages, analyzes, and proves governance at fleet scale. It is a **completely separate codebase** from the OSS.

### What SaaS Is NOT
- ❌ A hosted version of `loopers`.
- ❌ A codebase that imports or shares code with `loopers`.
- ❌ A system that trusts the OSS proxy to handle auth, identity, or tenant isolation.

### SaaS Boundary Map

| Capability | In SaaS? | Rationale |
|---|:---:|---|
| **Managed Agent Registry & NHI** (SPIFFE-compatible) | ✅ | Centralized identity issuance, rotation, and revocation across thousands of agents. |
| **Centralized Policy Fleet Management** | ✅ | GitOps UI to push OPA/Cedar policies to every Loopers proxy globally. |
| **Hierarchical Multi-Tenant Budgets** (org→team→project→key→session) | ✅ | Enterprise financial governance. Complex Redis orchestration requiring multi-tenant state. |
| **Decision Provenance Dashboard** | ✅ | SIEM-like UI visualizing agent reasoning chains, tool invocations, and policy evaluations. |
| **Algorithmic Drift Detection** | ✅ | ML over telemetry data to detect behavioral anomalies, prompt injection, and rogue agents. |
| **Dynamic AgBOM Generation** | ✅ | Real-time inventory of agent models, tools, MCP servers. EU AI Act compliance artifact. |
| **Cryptographic Action Receipts** | ✅ | Hash-linked Merkle proofs of every allow/deny decision. Offline auditor verification. |
| **Automated Compliance Reports** (EU AI Act, SOC 2, NIST AI RMF) | ✅ | One-click PDF/JSON reports mapping agent activity to regulatory articles. |
| **Behavioral Anomaly Engine** | ✅ | Statistical models trained on aggregate customer data. Cross-customer threat intelligence. |
| **SIEM Integrations** (Palo Alto XSIAM, Splunk, CrowdStrike, Sentinel) | ✅ | Native event emission for enterprise security stacks. |
| **Team Management + RBAC + SSO/SAML** | ✅ | Enterprise auth and access control. |
| **"Loopers Verified" Certification** | ✅ | Certification program for frameworks and enterprises. |
| **Policy Marketplace** | ✅ | Third-party policy packs (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS). |

> [!WARNING]
> **The SaaS enforcement engine is NOT a vendored import of `loopers`.** It is a reimplemented, hardened version in a private repository.

## 11. The Zero-Trust Boundary: Why OSS ≠ SaaS

### The Threat Model

```
1. Attacker clones loopers repository
2. Uses frontier AI models (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini) to perform automated code audit
3. Discovers vulnerability in request parsing, key validation, or Lua scripts
4. Attempts to exploit the same vulnerability in Loopers Cloud
5. FAILS — because the SaaS does not use the OSS codebase for these paths
```

As of June 2026, AI-driven exploit tools can autonomously scan codebases, trace data paths, and generate functional exploit code. Median time from vulnerability disclosure to exploitation has collapsed to under 5 days. For OSS-to-SaaS attacks, there is no disclosure — the attacker finds it themselves.

### The Five Rules of Separation

#### Rule 1: Separate Codebases
- `loopers`: Public GitHub repo. MIT license. Community contributions.
- `loopers-cloud`: Private repo. Closed source. Separate CI/CD. Separate team access.
- **Zero `import` or `go mod require` from `loopers` in `loopers-cloud`.**

#### Rule 2: Zero Shared Auth or Session Code
- OSS: Simple bearer tokens (`lp-xxx`) validated against Redis hashes. In the future: Verification of statelessly issued JWTs.
- SaaS: OAuth 2.0/OIDC for dashboard. mTLS for service-to-service. Per-tenant encryption keys. Token minting.
- An exploit against `internal/keyring/` has **zero applicability** to SaaS auth because they share zero code.

#### Rule 3: The SaaS Never Trusts the OSS Proxy
When an enterprise connects their self-hosted OSS proxy to the SaaS control plane:
- The SaaS treats the OSS proxy as an **untrusted client**.
- All communication is authenticated (mTLS), encrypted, and rate-limited.
- The SaaS independently validates every telemetry event, policy request, and budget report the proxy sends.
- The proxy has **zero access** to the control plane database (policies, user accounts, billing, other tenants).

#### Rule 4: Adversarial Auditing Before Every SaaS Release
1. **AI Red Team:** Run frontier models against `loopers` with explicit instructions to find exploits. Fix in OSS *before* deploying SaaS.
2. **Differential Analysis:** Automated CI/CD step comparing any shared algorithmic patterns (e.g., Lua scripts). Flag for manual review.
3. **SBOM Generation:** Track every shared dependency.

#### Rule 5: Blast Radius Containment (Assume Breach)
Even if an attacker fully compromises the enforcement engine within SaaS:
- **Tenant isolation** prevents lateral movement (per-tenant Redis keyspaces, per-tenant encryption).
- **The enforcement engine has zero access** to the control plane database.
- **Zero-Storage Architecture:** The enforcement engine persists zero API keys, request bodies, or response bodies. A full compromise yields zero customer data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Zero-Storage Architecture is your greatest security asset.** Because the enforcement path never persists sensitive data, even a complete compromise of the proxy/enforcement component yields nothing of value. This is not a feature — it is the architectural defense that makes the OSS-to-SaaS attack vector fundamentally worthless.

## 12. The Business Model — "Protected Spend" Pricing

### The Model
Loopers charges a percentage of the AI spend it governs, with a guaranteed savings floor.

```
Monthly Fee = max(Platform Minimum, Protected Spend × Rate)
```

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Protected Spend / Month | Rate | Platform Min | Effective Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starter** | $0 – $10K | 3.0% | $0 (free) | $300 |
| **Growth** | $10K – $100K | 1.5% | $150/mo | $1,500 |
| **Enterprise** | $100K – $1M | 0.8% | $800/mo | $8,000 |
| **Scale** | $1M+ | 0.4% | Custom | Custom |

### Revenue Projection

| Year | Customers | Avg Protected Spend | Avg Rev/Customer | ARR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 50 | $50K/mo | $750/mo | $450K |
| Year 2 | 300 | $80K/mo | $1,200/mo | $4.3M |
| Year 3 | 1,500 | $150K/mo | $1,800/mo | $32.4M |

### The Lock-In Mechanism
Once an enterprise writes 200 OPA/Rego policies in Loopers Cloud, configures hierarchical budgets across 50 teams, and builds compliance workflows around our audit reports — they are not switching. The policies and configurations become the product.

### The Conversion Trigger
When an organization has 10+ OSS proxies across multiple environments and cannot answer:
- "What is our total agent spend?"
- "Did any agent access unauthorized tools this week?"
- "Can we prove to auditors that governance was active?"

...they buy the SaaS.

## 14. What Loopers Must Never Do

### 1. Never Build an LLM Router
Don't add model fallback, load balancing, or routing to the OSS core. That's LiteLLM and Bifrost's game. Loopers sits *alongside* routers. The existing budget-aware fallback in `server.go` is acceptable (falling back to a cheaper model when budget is exhausted), but general-purpose routing must never be added.

### 2. Never Build a Dashboard in OSS
The dashboard is a SaaS feature. The enforcement engine is the OSS product. If the dashboard goes down, agents are still protected. If the engine goes down, agents are blocked (fail-closed). The dashboard is glass; the engine is steel.

### 3. Never Compromise the Zero-Storage Guarantee
The moment Loopers persists an API key, request body, or response body to disk, the entire security narrative collapses. Every new feature must be validated against this constraint.

### 4. Never Sacrifice Latency for Intelligence
Sub-millisecond proxy overhead is a hard benchmark. Any feature adding >2ms to the hot path must be optional and off-by-default. Behavioral detection runs asynchronously. Policy evaluation is cached. The proxy path is sacred.

### 5. Never Import OSS Code into the SaaS
The SaaS must never `import` or `require` the OSS Go module. Shared algorithmic concepts (e.g., the Lua budget scripts) may be reimplemented, but the surrounding code — request parsing, input sanitization, auth, error handling — must be written independently. A vulnerability in `loopers` must have zero exploitability against `loopers-cloud`.

### 6. Never Open-Source the Intelligence Layer
Behavioral models, cross-customer threat intelligence, anomaly detection algorithms, drift detection ML — these are the SaaS moat. Open-sourcing them gives away the only thing competitors cannot replicate: intelligence trained on aggregate enforcement data.

## 15. Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP) & Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Governance

As the AI agent landscape matures, security must shift from static, long-lived credentials to Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP) and dynamic context mediation. To retain category dominance, Loopers OSS implements the execution-layer controls for this architecture, while leaving the management, scaling, and auditing complexities to Loopers Cloud.

This evolution tightly couples with the 6-Layer Stack (Section 2) and acts as the bridge connecting Identity, Execution, and Compliance:
- **Layer 1 (Identity)** moves from static API keys to ephemeral, cryptographically bound JWTs.
- **Layer 2 (Policy)** gains context-aware escalation paths.
- **Layer 3 (Interception)** mediates Agent-to-Agent (A2A) trust handoffs.
- **Layer 6 (Compliance)** gains irrefutable proof of delegation via token chains.

### 1. ZSP OIDC Verification (Layer 1 - Identity)
Rather than managing static API keys (`lp-xxx`), Loopers OSS shifts to verifying ephemeral, short-lived Agent Delegation JWTs minted by an identity authority (SaaS Control Plane or Okta/Entra ID).
- **Signature Verification:** The OSS proxy statelessly verifies incoming JWT signatures using a cached JWKS endpoint.
- **Latency Guarantee:** Cryptographic token checks run in under 150 microseconds, preserving the sub-millisecond hot path.
- **DPoP Token Binding:** The proxy enforces Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (RFC 9449), validating that the token cannot be replayed even if an agent host is completely compromised.
- **Fail-Closed Constraint:** If JWKS lookup fails or the JWT signature is invalid, the proxy aborts the request immediately.

### 2. Dynamic Consent Escalation (Layer 2 & Layer 3)
Under ZSP, agents start with least privileges. When an agent attempts an action that exceeds its active scope (e.g., spending over budget, invoking an unapproved tool):
- **Proxy Interception (L3):** The OSS proxy suspends the HTTP/MCP request mid-flight and publishes a JIT (Just-in-Time) escalation event to Redis/NATS.
- **Asynchronous Resumption:** The proxy holds the request open while waiting for the SaaS approval broker (Control Plane) to notify a human and confirm permission upgrade. If approved, the proxy resumes execution. If denied, it terminates the request cleanly.

### 3. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Mediation (Layer 3 & Layer 6)
When an agent autonomously delegates a task to another agent, execution context and budgets are easily lost.
- **Delegation Propagation:** Loopers OSS intercepts inter-agent communications and ensures downstream calls carry the parent agent's cryptographically linked delegation chain.
- **Unified Budget Caps:** Downstream tool executions are dynamically charged against the parent session's budget limits. The OSS verifies these boundaries statelessly via its Redis Lua engine.
- **Compliance Proofs (L6):** The SaaS platform uses these nested token chains to generate cryptographically verifiable Action Receipts, proving to auditors exactly which human or parent agent delegated the authority for any action.

### 4. Codebase Boundary for ZSP
Consistent with the Zero-Trust Boundary (Section 11):
- **OSS (Data Plane):** Implements JWT parsing, JWKS caching, DPoP validation, and request suspension. It trusts nothing except the mathematical signature of the tokens.
- **SaaS (Control Plane):** Implements human-in-the-loop workflows, UI dashboards for JIT approval, OIDC token minting, and identity federation.
